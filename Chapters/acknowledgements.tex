First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor, Armanda Rodrigues, and co-advisors, Inês Coutinho and Nuno Correia. Their assistance and support were priceless throughout this dissertation.

I am also extremely grateful to the Department of Computer Science for providing all the necessary resources and facilities to carry out this work. My thanks also go to the research center VICARTE for the support, materials, and space that made it possible to conduct the user evaluation.

A special thanks to Inês Vaz Pinto, responsible for the Roman Ruins of Troia, for her openness and availability in welcoming us to visit the space, as well as for the necessary materials she kindly provided, which were fundamental to achieving the desired results.
I would also like to acknowledge Sofia Pires for her contribution in providing the 3D models of the artefacts, and to Professor João Lourenço for making the report template openly available.

Finally, a big thank you to my family and friends for their constant encouragement and support during this dissertation and my entire academic journey.
