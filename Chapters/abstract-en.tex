%Regardless of the language in which the dissertation is written, usually there are at least two abstracts: one abstract in the same language as the main text, and another abstract in some other language.

%The abstracts' order varies with the school.  If your school has specific regulations concerning the abstracts' order, the \gls{novathesis} (\LaTeX) template will respect them.  Otherwise, the default rule in the \gls{novathesis} template is to have in first place the abstract in \emph{the same language as main text}, and then the abstract in \emph{the other language}. For example, if the dissertation is written in Portuguese, the abstracts' order will be first Portuguese and then English, followed by the main text in Portuguese. If the dissertation is written in English, the abstracts' order will be first English and then Portuguese, followed by the main text in English.

%However, this order can be customized by adding one of the following to the file \verb+5_packages.tex+.

%\begin{verbatim}
  %  \ntsetup{abstractorder={<LANG_1>,...,<LANG_N>}}
 %   \ntsetup{abstractorder={<MAIN_LANG>={<LANG_1>,...,<LANG_N>}}}
%\end{verbatim}

%For example, for a main document written in German with abstracts written in German, English and Italian (by this order) use:
%\begin{verbatim}
 %   \ntsetup{abstractorder={de={de,en,it}}}
%\end{verbatim}

%Concerning its contents, the abstracts should not exceed one page and may answer the following questions (it is essential to adapt to the usual practices of your scientific area):

% Nowadays, the significant historical and cultural heritage of Tróia remains largely unknown. 
% This project studies luxury glass from ancient Rome, found in a luxurious grave.


% The goal of this dissertation is to raise awareness of this valuable discovery through the development of several digital tools 
% that will support the dissemination of this study, contribute to preserving its cultural value, and share its findings. 
% This challenging project is currently starting and aims for future continuity in its development, with a great potential for further progress. 
% This theme touches on various areas of Computer Science and Engineering, some of which are not covered in classes, making it a great opportunity to expand my technical knowledge. 
% Additionally, it will help improve soft skills such as autonomy, creativity, and critical thinking by planning and structuring the project's different steps and integrating its components.


%  The proposed solution involves the development of some interacting platforms, including an interactive map of the Tróia Peninsula, a repository featuring literature on Tróia's excavations, 
%  and an augmented reality (AR) experience focusing on "augmenting" a visit to an existing physical object. 
%  In the end, all these elements will be integrated into a digital environment as 3D models. 
%  These technologies will enrich the experience of online visitors of the Tróia ruins, allowing them to interact with rare luxury artefacts from the Roman Empire. 
%  Furthermore, positively impact people and increase their knowledge about this important archeological site while preserving its cultural legacy.

Nowadays, the significant historical and cultural heritage of the Roman Ruins of Troia remains largely unknown to the public. This dissertation focuses on unique luxury glass artefacts found in a recently discovered Roman tomb in Troia, Setúbal.

The need to raise awareness of this valuable discovery led to the collaboration between the Computer Science and Conservation and Restoration departments at NOVA FCT and archaeologists from the Roman Ruins of Troia. The project involved the development of a virtual reality environment to disseminate this study, preserve its cultural value, share its findings, and offer great potential for future progress.

This work covers the integration of collected data, including excavation records, interventions, and artefact data from the site, and the preliminary development of a virtual reality application. The collected data is stored in a database that serves as a central repository. The virtual environment presents an experience focusing on virtually immersing users in a visit to an existing tomb within a funerary enclosure featuring two objects and an interactive base map of the western archaeological site of Troia. The funerary enclosure and objects were integrated into the environment as 3D models. Additionally, the users can interact with a virtual panel, view details about objects, toggle the site plan, and view a funerary profile. These elements allow users to explore a map featuring a funerary enclosure and engage with rare luxury artefacts from the Roman Empire. 

In a final stage, the resulting experience was tested with 28 participants from diverse backgrounds. The results were evaluated through a questionnaire assessing task usability, sense of presence, and overall user experience. The evaluation indicated a generally positive outcome, with a few improvements subsequently implemented based on user feedback.
