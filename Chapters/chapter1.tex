\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}
Archeology gives us the tools to examine and explain human behavior, understand how 
society functions, learn from the past and apply those lessons to the present, and analyze
 the drivers and implications of a changing world and how different countries, places, and cultures interact.~\cite{oxfordarchaeology2025}

 This project will study the exploration of luxury glass from ancient Rome.
The central motivation of this dissertation is the research of remains and artifacts, not
 only to preserve the \gls{CH} but also to transmit ancestral patrimony knowledge to everyone, including future generations. 
 The growing integration of digital tools with arts enhances online 
facilities for users, as well as democratizes access to art, allowing more people to engage 
\gls{CH} in meaningful ways. Furthermore, by integrating technology with these archeological 
discoveries we want to raise the value of this archeology site and make it accessible on a global scale.



\section{Context}
\label{sec:context}
This thesis is currently starting in collaboration with \gls{VICARTE}\footnote{\url{https://vicarte.org/about-us/}}. \gls{VICARTE} is a glass and 
ceramic research unit created as a partnership between the NOVA School of Science and Technology and the Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Lisbon, with members from the Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Oporto, the School of Arts and Design, Polytechnic Institute of Leiria, and Cultural Institutions.
The investigation at \gls{VICARTE} is based on two interconnecting pillars: Glass and Ceramics in Contemporaneity and in \gls{CH}. 

Historically, the Roman ruins of Tróia represent the largest known fish-salting production complex, built in the first half of the first century, and continuously occupied until the 6th century. 
The site of Tróia is located on the southwestern coast of Portugal, on a sand embankment between the estuary of the Sado River and the atlantic ocean.~\cite{pinto2018reassessment} 

Today, this place is owned by Sonae Capital Group\footnote{\url{https://www.sonae.pt/pt/}} and is associated with the Tróia Resort\footnote{\url{https://www.troiaresort.pt/en/troia-roman-ruins/}}.
The ruins extend along two kilometers of the Sado River estuary, comprising twenty-five fish-salting workshops.~\cite{hocquet2015fish}
A site of outstanding  universal value, with a unique magnitude, which has influenced the economy of an entire region and its development up to the present day.~\cite{unesco_troia} 
A protocol in 2005 was established that enabled the hiring of an archaeological team responsible for the preservation, maintenance, and enhancement of the Tróia archaeological remains.~\cite{pinto2014ruinas} In 2007,
a new project was launched to present the Roman ruins, leading to the installation of visitor pathways with interpretation panels, and the site officially opened to the public on February 2011. 
Currently, artifacts collections from Tróia are exhibited in various institutions, including the National Museum of Archaeology, the Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography of the District of Setúbal, and the City Council of Grândola.

\section{Problem Description and Objectives}
\label{sec:problem_description_and_objectives} 
%, this concept will be explained better in section X.
This study will concentrate on glass relics discovered in the mausoleum of a wealthy woman who lived in the Tróia Peninsula. The data collected from the excavations include 
images of the discovered glasses both before and after conservation, and photographs documenting the entire excavation process. 
This information was provided by \gls{VICARTE}.

This project aims to develop three digital tools in parallel, with a subsequent phase dedicated to 
integrating them into a cohesive web app.


Primarily, a data repository that compiles and organizes literature and findings from 
the Tróia excavations, focusing specifically on glass objects. A database will be needed to store this data. 
This database will store essential information such as an object ID, location points, object utility,
conservation status, origin, symbolic and decorative meanings, and comparisons with similar glass artifacts, using characteristics such as shape and uniqueness. 
This repository will serve as a data source for the other tools.


The second tool will be an interactive map of the Tróia Peninsula, involving several layers of information, positioning each 
artifact found inside a grave. These layers will contain not only data from excavations but also, 
studied evidence enumerated above in the first development phase, the data repository.
 
Furthermore, an \gls{AR} experience focusing on augmenting a visit of an existing physical 
artifact to enable visitors to handle precious fragile antiquities, added to the environment as 3D models. 
It should use emerging display methods, such as the ones provided by augmented reality glasses.
The database will be the backbone of the other two tools described above, feeding the interactive map with data and supporting the \gls{AR} experience.
Once developed, the three tools will be integrated to form a unified platform enabling dynamic exploration of Tróia's archaeological findings.
through an interconnected data repository, and a visualization and interaction platform.
%This will be done using some technologies: Unity…

\section{Expected Contributions}
\label{sec:expected_contributions}


By the end of the development of this dissertation, the following contributions are expected:


\begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Virtual Platform:}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Interactive Map} - User-friendly map that allows users to explore geographical and historical locations interactively.
      \item \textbf{3D Object Manipulation} - Enables users to interact with, and manipulate virtual 3D objects, enhancing their engagement.
   \end{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Data Repository} - A comprehensive database containing all existing data, accessible to users through interactions with the map or \gls{AR} enhanced objects.
   \item \textbf{User's Cultural Enrichment} - Provide users an engaging and interactive experience that enriches their understanding and interest
   in Roman cultural heritage, making learning both enjoyable and meaningful.
   On top of that, through the integration of \gls{AR}, users will have the opportunity to virtually interact with glass made historical objects.
\end{itemize}
