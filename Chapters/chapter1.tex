\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}
Archaeology offers methods for interpreting human behavior and societal structures. By studying the past, archaeology provides insights that can be applied to the present~\footnote{\url{https://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/why-archaeology-matters}}.
Furthermore, it allows us to analyse the impacts of a changing world and the interactions among diverse countries, regions, and cultures.

This project will study the exploration of luxury glass from ancient Rome.
The central motivation of this dissertation is the research of remains and artefacts, not
only to preserve the \gls{CH} but also to transmit ancestral patrimony knowledge to everyone, including future generations. 
The growing integration of digital tools with arts enhances online 
facilities for users and democratizes access to art. Additionally, it cultivates a deeper understanding of ancient cultures and traditions, allowing more people to engage with
\gls{CH} in meaningful ways. Moreover, by integrating technology with these archaeological 
discoveries, the goal is to raise the value of this archaeological site and make it accessible for an immersive and engaging \gls{VR} experience.


\section{Context}
\label{sec:context}

This thesis will be developed under the umbrella of an interdisciplinary collaboration between NOVA LINCS\footnote{\url{https://nova-lincs.di.fct.unl.pt/}} and \gls{VICARTE}\footnote{\url{https://vicarte.org/about-us/}}.
\gls{VICARTE} is a glass and ceramic research unit created as a partnership between the NOVA School of Science and Technology and the Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Lisbon, with members from the Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Oporto, the School of Arts and Design, Polytechnic Institute of Leiria, and Cultural Institutions.
The research at \gls{VICARTE} is based on two interconnecting pillars: Glass and Ceramics in Contemporaneity and in \gls{CH}. 

Historically, the Roman ruins of Troia represent the largest known fish-salting production complex, built in the first half of the first century, and continuously occupied until the 6th century. 
The site of Troia is located on the southwestern coast of Portugal, on a sand embankment between the estuary of the Sado River and the atlantic ocean~\cite{pinto2018reassessment}.

The ruins extend along two kilometers of the Sado River estuary, comprising twenty-five fish-salting workshops~\cite{hocquet2015fish}.
A site of outstanding value, with a unique magnitude, which has influenced the economy of an entire region and its development up to the present day~\cite{unesco_troia}.
In 2005, a protocol was established that enabled the hiring of an archaeological team responsible for the preservation, maintenance, and enhancement of the Troia archaeological remains~\cite{pinto2014ruinas}. In 2007,
a new project was launched to provide public access to the Roman ruins, leading to the installation of visitor pathways with interpretation panels. The site officially opened to the public in February 2011. 
Currently, artefact collections from Troia are exhibited in various institutions, including the National Museum of Archaeology\footnote{\url{https://www.museunacionalarqueologia.gov.pt/}}, the Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography of the District of Setúbal\footnote{\url{https://maeds.amrs.pt/}}, and the City Council of Grândola\footnote{\url{https://www.cm-grandola.pt/}}. The specific glass artefacts under study are housed at the National Museum of Archaeology.

\section{Problem Description and Objectives}
\label{sec:problem_description_and_objectives} 
%, this concept will be explained better in section X.
This study will concentrate on glass relics discovered in the mausoleum of a wealthy woman who lived in the Troia Peninsula. The data collected from the studies and excavations include 
data from the artifacts, excavation, and intervention process, such as images of the discovered glasses both before and after conservation. 
This information was provided by \gls{VICARTE}.

This project aims to develop two digital tools in parallel, with a third element to build the communication between these two.


Primarily, a data repository that compiles and organizes findings from 
a Troia funerary enclosure, focusing specifically on glass objects found inside. A database will be needed to store this data. 
This database will store essential objects' information, such as object ID, location details, object utility,
conservation status, origin, symbolic and decorative meanings, and comparisons with similar glass artefacts, using characteristics such as shape and uniqueness, defined with a link to the parallel discovery. 
This repository will serve as a data source for the \gls{VE}.

The second tool, and the main focus of this dissertation, is a \gls{VR} experience focusing on immersing a visit to an existing physical 
artefact to enable visitors to handle precious fragile antiquities, added to the environment as \gls{3D} models. 
Two of these object models are already completed and were supplied by the researchers involved in the project.
Also, the users have the possibility to view a simulation of how the glass artefacts would look originally. 

In this environment, an interactive map of this Troia Occidental site is also integrated, containing useful tooltips, points of interest, and the grave within the funerary enclosure model positioned above this map. 
This map is the base ground plan, where the user can walk and explore, and there is the functionality to toggle to another layer of this site.

The users can interact with this environment with the use of the emerging \gls{VR} glasses display.
There is also a backend implementation, which is the backbone of the two interactive tools described, feeding the \gls{VE} with informative data that comes from the repository.

\section{Expected Contributions}
\label{sec:expected_contributions}


By the end of the development of this dissertation, the following contributions are expected:


\begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Virtual Platform:}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{\gls{VR} Immersive Experience} - Enables users to view and explore the funerary enclosure model with the map as ground plane, and interact with and manipulate virtual \gls{3D} objects within. Additionally, navigate on a user-friendly map that allows users to visit these historical sites, and provides a sense of presence in this real \gls{CH} space.
      \item  \textbf{Data Repository} - A comprehensive database containing all available data, accessible to users through interactions with the map or the \gls{3D} models.
   \end{itemize}
   \item \textbf{User's Cultural Enrichment} - Provide users an engaging and interactive experience that enriches their understanding and interest
   in Roman \gls{CH}, making learning both enjoyable and meaningful.
   On top of that, through the integration of \gls{VR}, users will have the opportunity to virtually interact with glass-made historical objects, and go back in time.
\end{itemize}
